# Introduction

## Why another web framework?

Modern websites typically have two components that are tightly coupled - one running in the browser 
and the other on the server. These components are often written in different programming languages 
and must communicate through an HTTP(S) connection. Kweb aims to eliminate this separation between the 
server and browser so you can focus on building your website or user interface without worrying about the 
underlying details.

## What is Kweb?

Kweb is a remote interface for a web browser's DOM (Document Object Model). With Kweb, you can create 
and manipulate DOM elements, and listen for and handle events, all using an intuitive Kotlin DSL that mirrors 
the structure of the HTML being created. Kweb is built on the Ktor framework, which handles HTTP, HTTPS, and 
WebSocket transport, and is optimized to minimize latency and resource usage on both the server and browser.

## Features

* End-to-end Kotlin - Write your entire web site or user interface in Kotlin, without needing to communicate between a browser and server.
* Real-time synchronization of your back-end data with your web page - Kweb takes care of all the plumbing for you.
* Server-side HTML rendering with hydration - Kweb can render your HTML on the server before sending it to the browser, so the browser doesn't have to do any rendering.
* Efficient instruction preloading - Kweb can avoid unnecessary server communication by preloading instructions.
* Very lightweight - Kweb is less than 5,000 lines of code.
